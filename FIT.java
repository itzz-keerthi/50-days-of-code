Each test case contains of a single line consisting of single integer XX.
Output Format
For each test case, output the number of kilometers Chef travels through office trips in a week.

Constraints

Explanation:
Test case 11: The office is 11 km away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk 22 kms in a day. In a week with 55 working days, Chef has to travel 2\cdot 5 = 102⋅5=10 kms in total.

Test case 22: The office is 33 kms away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk 66 kms in a day. In a week with 55 working days, Chef has to travel 6\cdot 5 = 306⋅5=30 kms in total.

Test case 33: The office is 77 kms away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk 1414 kms in a day. In a week with 55 working days, Chef has to travel 14\cdot 5 = 7014⋅5=70 kms in total.

Test case 44: The office is 1010 kms away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk 2020 kms in a day. In a week with 55 working days, Chef has to travel 20\cdot 5 = 10020⋅5=100 kms in total.  */
